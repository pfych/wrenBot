## Platform Support

This bot supports every platform the [song.link](song.link) platform supports as it takes advantage of its API

## What does it store?

Currently Wrenbot only stores requested albums, Not who requested them or which server the request came from. This cache is only persistent between restarts as it's mainly in place to lower the load on the [song.link](song.link) API. Down the road, I do plan on making this database slightly more persistent with a database that clears every few days.

## Support & Maintenance
