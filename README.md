# Wrenbot (DEPRECATED)

**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED [VIEW NEW REPO HERE](https://github.com/Puffycheeses/music_linkr)**

Automatically translate streaming service links

## Platform Support

This bot supports every platform the [song.link](song.link) platform supports as it takes advantage of its API

Currently it detects the following URL Schemes:

- Spotify
- Apple Music
- Deezer
- Soundcloud
- Google Music
- Youtube (Prepend links with `?`)

## What does it store?

Currently Wrenbot only stores requested albums, Not who requested them or which server the request came from. This cache is only persistent between restarts as it's mainly in place to lower the load on the [song.link](song.link) API. Down the road, I do plan on making this database slightly more persistent with a database that clears every few days.

## Support & Maintenance

Please contact me via Discord @Puffycheeses#0001 or via email attached to this Github account. If you have any problems with the bot or suggestions please create a Github issue.
